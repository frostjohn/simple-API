Coding Challenge 30-45mins

Write a simple API using Rails 4 app that responds to the following requests:
GET /listings/hawaii-bungalo and returns the json {name: Hawaii Bungalow, price: 145} and then POST/listings to create a new listing, in response it returns the new listing in json

Do not worry about authentication/authorization and a front end API (simply a json API). Welcome to add any gems you require. 

Once completed please clone the repo and commit your work to it. We will review your code and then set up a time to chat (Either weekdays or weekends). If time your time is limited please let us know your availability. Thanks
